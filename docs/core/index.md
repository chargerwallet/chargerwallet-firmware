# Chargerwallet Core

Chargerwallet Core is the second-gen firmware running on Chargerwallet devices. It currently runs on Chargerwallet Touch only, but it will probably be used on Chargerwallet mini/classic in future as well.

Chargerwallet Core is part of the chargerwallet-firmware monorepo to be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/chargerwallet/firmware), in the `core` subdirectory.
